# GreenPack Solutions - IT Security and Access Management Policy

## 1. Introduction
GreenPack Solutions is committed to safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its information systems and data. This policy outlines the standards for managing access credentials, protecting data, monitoring systems, and ensuring compliance with internal and external security requirements.

## 2. Password Policy
All user passwords must contain at least twelve (12) characters, including upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special symbols. Passwords must not include easily guessable information such as employee names or company slogans.
Passwords must be rotated every ninety (90) days. Reuse of the previous five (5) passwords is prohibited.  
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for VPN, email, and cloud application access. Users must report any suspicious MFA prompt immediately.

## 3. Access Keys and API Credentials
Developers and system administrators must use unique access keys for each environment (development, staging, production).  
Access keys must be rotated every sixty (60) days and revoked immediately if an employee leaves or changes roles.  
The DevOps team manages access key issuance through the internal credential vault. Credentials are never stored in plaintext, version control, or configuration files.

## 4. User Roles and Privileges
Access is granted following the principle of least privilege. Users are assigned the minimum set of permissions required for their duties.  
System administrators review role assignments quarterly. Any elevated privilege must be approved by both IT Security and the employee’s department head.

Temporary access (e.g., for contractors) expires automatically after 14 days unless explicitly extended.  
All administrative actions are logged and retained for audit purposes for at least one year.

## 5. Network and VPN Policy
All employees connecting remotely must use the company VPN. The VPN requires MFA and automatically disconnects after 30 minutes of inactivity.  
Network traffic is monitored using intrusion detection systems (IDS) and endpoint protection software.  
The IT department performs quarterly penetration tests and reports findings to executive management.

## 6. Data Classification
Data is classified into four categories:
1. **Public** – Approved for general release.
2. **Internal** – Shared within GreenPack only.
3. **Confidential** – Shared with authorized departments.
4. **Restricted** – Sensitive data such as customer records or financial reports.

All restricted data must be encrypted at rest and in transit. Encryption keys are rotated annually.

## 7. Backup and Disaster Recovery
Daily backups are stored in AWS S3 with versioning enabled. A secondary backup is maintained in Azure Blob Storage.  
Backups are tested monthly to ensure recoverability. Disaster recovery drills are performed twice a year, simulating loss of key infrastructure.

## 8. Incident Response
Any employee who suspects a security incident must report it immediately to security@greenpack.com.  
The incident response team (IRT) triages alerts within 30 minutes and documents findings in the internal tracking system.  
Critical incidents trigger a post-incident review within 5 business days, with lessons learned distributed to relevant teams.

## 9. Change Management
All infrastructure or code changes must go through the change management workflow in Jira.  
Each change request must include:
- Risk assessment
- Rollback plan
- Testing results
- Peer approval  
Emergency changes require approval from at least one manager and must be documented retroactively.

## 10. Device Security
All laptops must use full-disk encryption, password-protected BIOS, and company-approved antivirus software.  
Employees must lock screens when leaving workstations unattended.  
Lost or stolen devices must be reported within 1 hour. The IT Security team will remotely wipe corporate data using the MDM platform.

## 11. Email and Phishing
Employees must complete mandatory phishing awareness training annually.  
Suspicious emails should be reported using the "Report Phish" button in Outlook.  
IT Security sends quarterly phishing simulations to monitor awareness metrics.

## 12. Cloud Services
Use of external cloud services must be approved by IT and comply with the company’s data residency policy.  
All cloud storage must enable encryption, access logging, and MFA.  
Public S3 buckets are prohibited. Violations trigger an automatic compliance alert.

## 13. Vendor and Third-Party Risk
Vendors with access to company systems or data must sign a Data Processing Agreement (DPA).  
Third-party risk assessments are conducted annually and before any major contract renewal.

## 14. Physical Security
Access to the data center is restricted to authorized personnel only, using badge and biometric verification.  
Visitors must sign in, display badges, and be escorted at all times.  
Security cameras record all entry points 24/7, and logs are retained for 90 days.

## 15. Compliance
GreenPack Solutions complies with ISO 27001 and SOC 2 Type II standards.  
Quarterly audits verify control effectiveness. Non-compliance may result in disciplinary action up to termination.

## 16. Enforcement
Employees violating this policy may face suspension or termination.  
Repeated negligence (e.g., sharing credentials, disabling security tools) is considered a major violation.  
IT Security reserves the right to monitor systems to ensure compliance.

## 17. Revision History
- **Version 1.0 (Jan 2022):** Initial release.  
- **Version 1.1 (Jan 2023):** Added MFA requirement and access key rotation.  
- **Version 1.2 (Oct 2024):** Expanded incident response and vendor risk sections.
